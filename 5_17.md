## Block

The concept of Block usually means and implies convolution - ReLu - Pooling



### InceptionNet

Is is the neural network developed by Google. It concatenated the outputs of filter 3X3 and 5X5, since there was not proven theory that support which filters outperform the other.



Even though, the outcomes from multiple branches have different number of channels, all of then should have same size of the output images. And all the outputs are concatenated.





### <br>1 X 1 convolution

Purpose: To compress the information from multiple channels.

6 X 6 X 32  *  6 X 6 X 32  =  6 X 6 X 1

Even though the each channels information is deactivated, compressed information from multiple channels could be contained in the output (6 X 6 X 1). The output channel could also be any number instead of 1.



6 X 6 X 32 

​	-> Using 3 X 3 filter: method 1: ( 3 X 3 X 32 ) X 10 = 2880

​	-> Using 1 X 1 filter: method 2: ( 1 X 1 X 32 ) X 10 + ( 3 X 3 X 10 ) X 10 = 1220
